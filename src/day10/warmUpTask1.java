1. write a program that can identify if the given character is Alphabetic
            ex:
                character = 'a'
            output:
                a is an Alphabetic
                character  = '!'
            output:
                ! is not  anAlphabetic

                ascii table:
                        65 ~ 90 ==> A~Z
                        97 ~ 122 ==> a~z
